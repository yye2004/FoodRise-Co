# FoodRise-Co
FoodRise Co. focuses on developing a website to act as a central platform for mobilizing resources, engaging communities, and driving long-term systemic change in eliminating hunger (SDG 2: Zero Hunger).

This website is a comprehensive platform developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, focusing on the goal of zero hunger. It integrates various features such as donation modules for food and monetary contributions, dynamic event handling, and user management. The back-end functionality, powered by PHP and database connectivity, supports administrative controls for managing users, events, and donations, as well as user-centric features like dashboards, rewards, and event registration. The website includes support pages like FAQs, privacy policy, and contact forms to enhance user experience and trust. Designed with visually appealing stylesheets and images, the platform also incorporates a structured SQL database to manage operations efficiently. By implementing concepts learned throughout the semester, this project demonstrates a practical and socially impactful approach to web development.
